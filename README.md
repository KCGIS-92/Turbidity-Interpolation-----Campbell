# Turbidity as a Measure of River Health - Campbell


## Project Overview and Purpose

This project attempts to quantify the scale and change of water turbidity through September 23rd, 2024 – September 23rd, 2025, against the weighted historical average available in the Calgary Surface Water Quality Record for publication in the University of Calgary - State of Our City 2025 Atlas for Geography 587. Using simple overlay analysis and Inverse Distance Weighting Interpolation methods native to ArcGIS Pro to generate a layout estimating probable continuous turbidity values through generated, discrete, XY Sampling points; simple statistics summarization was utilized to generate a mean average site sample before these manipulated the file tables were joined and exported for Interpolation. This project should be referenced with extreme care, as it represents an undergraduate’s students first attempts at interpolation. Results should be validated against user error to ensure the conclusions are in fact dependable and with merit.

## Folder Structure Guide

### Central Repository: 
> This project repository contains the Usage Licence for this projects contents; Readme File with relevant project metadata and workflows; and Project Datasets & Masters to compile the project results.

### Data_Masters:
> This subfile contains all finished tables and shapefiles required to create the project layout and interpolation results as they were downloaded from the Calgary Open Data Portal.
### Data_Projects:
> This subfile contains the edited project files synthesised, cleaned, and organized from the master datasets to generate the project results. 



## CRS and Data Format Notes
> The Project Dataset are all projected in 3TM 114 projected coordinate system to reduce distortion for the Calgary area. The Master Datasets are natively hosted in WGS 1984 standard as per the Calgary Data Portal. 
- Vector and Table Data stored in Data_Project for this repository is saved in .shapfile zip folders as errors were encountered when packaging as .csv format. 
- The exported Raster files within the Project stored within the are stored as .tiff files for ease of use when importing from GitHub into ArcGIS Pro.


## Data Sources and Method Summary
>All Data was sourced from the Open Calgary Data Portal; summery statistics were tabulated using ArcGIS Pro's "Summery Statistics" function with simple mathematical equations generated by the author.


## Field Dictionary 

#### Community_Boundary_LanduseClassCodes_Project.zip
>The only relevant field of this File is *class_code* denoting the classification of land use for each Community Polygon. Used for overlay analysis to see if certain turbidity spikes are associated with land usage.
#### XYStatistics_Tables_Project.zip
>This file contains both the **TSS_Year_Totals_Point** and **TSS_Historic_Totals_Point.** These attributes apply additionally to the **Watershed_Surface_Water_Quality_Data_20251025.csv**
- **Sample Site:** Represents a single testing location for water parameters for the City of Calgary. Site Key serves as a secondary search key. 
- **Latitude:** Spatial identifier - Y coordinate for use with the XY to Point tool
- **Longitude:** Spatial identifier - x coordinate for use with the XY to Point tool
- **Frequency:** the number of testing results per Sample Site.
- **Parameter:** What water quality parameter is being tested
- **Mean_Numeric_Result:** Represents the average result of the parameter within a given interval of time.
- **Site_Weight:** Represents the weight attributed to each site based upon Frequency / Total Samples
- **Mean_Weighted**: The weighted average for each site calculated with the equation (Mean_Numeric_Result * Site_Weight)
- **Result Units:** the unit of measurement attributed to each Parameter.
